## What does it do now?

### Controll fuse circuts
By passing the circut from the fuse block through the relay block this device will be able to toggle (on/off) any circut from a phone or tablet on the same network.
Whats next:
* Controll circuts from anywhere via (currently you must be near the device)

### Leverage location data
By using the public API a user can see in realtime where the device is.
Whats next:
* Trigger circuts based on weather events (turn everything but the fridge off because its going to be cloudy) 
* Track cell service levels so that we can see which backroads have cell service

## Coming Soon:
* [ ] Voltage realtime monitor (0 - 42v) 
* [ ] Local Hotspot (share the internet connection via ip-tables)
